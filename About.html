        <div class="aboutme">
            <p>Hello, I am Matthew Green-Young and I am currently a Junior at the University of Oklahoma majoring in Management Information Systems. My hometown in Chickasha, Oklahoma but I have been living
                in Norman. Oklahoma as a student for the past two years.
                Some of the things I am passionate about are coding, data analysis, and systems analysis. 
                After I graduate, I hope to get a job in IT or Software Development.
                Outside of school and work, I enjoy running, playing badminton, learning japanese, and hanging out with friends.</p>
